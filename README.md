##Information
### Design
Remember that horrible support software that looked like it came straight from 1995? Yeah, with helpcat that's no more. We pay attention to design - Metro UI fits easily. This modern art, which offers so many options. Unfortunately, with the disadvantage that our client only runs with Windows Vista with .NET Framework 4.5 and higher.

###License
Helpcat is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We would be happy if you contributed something to our code. [Fork us on GitHub and create a pull request](https://github.com/wickeds/helpcat-client) or donate to support the development financially.

###Satisfied kittens
Helpcat prevents you from the sudden urge to kill cute kittens that you get from using other support software.

###Wickeds
Helpcat was launched by Wickeds in August 2012. At that time under a different name. Wickeds existed since early in 2011, however, a major project was never released. Wickeds consists of four people, three of these were integrated into Helpcat. There aren't any other (bigger) projects.
