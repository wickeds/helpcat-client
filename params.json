Yeah, with helpcat that's no more. We pay attention to design - Metro UI fits easily. This modern art, which offers so many options. Unfortunately, with the disadvantage that our client only runs with Windows Vista with .NET Framework 4.5 and higher.\r\n\r\n###License\r\nHelpcat is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. We would be happy if you contributed something to our code. [Fork us on GitHub and create a pull request](https://github.com/wickeds/helpcat-client) or donate to support the development financially.\r\n\r\n###Satisfied kittens\r\nHelpcat prevents you from the sudden urge to kill cute kittens that you get from using other support software.\r\n\r\n###Wickeds\r\nHelpcat was launched by Wickeds in August 2012. At that time under a different name. Wickeds existed since early in 2011, however, a major project was never released. Wickeds consists of four people, three of these were integrated into Helpcat. There aren't any other (bigger) projects.\r\n\r\n###Credits\r\nhelpcat uses the following third party libraries:\r\n* [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro)\r\n* [MahApps.Metro.Resources](https://github.com/mahapps/mahapps.metro)\r\n* [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/)\r\n\r\nhelpcat uses the following third party content:\r\n* http://www.freesound.org/people/cameronmusic/sounds/138419/\r\n* http://www.freesound.org/people/hoobtastic/sounds/124357/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
